# AI_Generated_Text_Detection

## Background:

This project aims to classify if a text is AI generated utilizing sentence embeddings of 768 dimensions created from text. The text used to generate these embeddings are not disclosed as a part of this challenge. But the text is encoded into 768 dimensionsal vector. The sentence embeddings are similar to word embeddings. Just as words that are quite similar to each other have word embeddings that are closer to each other, similar sentences are encoded into embeddings that are closer to each other in 768 dimensional space (Distance between embeddings of similar sentences is lower compared to that of dissimilar sentences).
